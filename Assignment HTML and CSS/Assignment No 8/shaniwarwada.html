    <h1>Shaniwarwada</h1>
    <p>
      The Shaniwar Wada was normally the seven-story capital building of the
      Peshwas of the Maratha Empire. It was supposed to be made entirely of
      stone but after the completion of the base floor or the first story, the
      people of Satara (the national capital) complained to the Chatrapati Shahu
      Maharaj(King) saying that a stone monument can be sanctioned and built
      only by the king himself and not the Peshwas. Following this, an official
      letter was written to the Peshwas stating that the remaining building had
      to be made of brick and not stone. Even today if you visit and see the
      walls carefully, they are partly made of stone and partly by bricks. The
      Wada was then completed and upon being attacked by the British Artillery
      90 years later, all the top six stories collapsed leaving only the stone
      base, which was immune to the British artillery. Hence only the stone base
      of the Shaniwar Wada remains and can be seen even today in the older parts
      of Pune. By 1758, at least a thousand people lived in the fort.
